# PhD - Generalized Deduplication in Practices (not the real title) 

I coundcted my PhD under the supervison of [Professor Daniel Lucani](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/daniel-enrique-lucani-roetter(c4e78b1e-4dd6-460f-9c44-1a44771ce01a).html) at Aarhus University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. 

My research focused on designing, implementing, and evaluating the worlds first object data storage and the world first file system (it was FUSE based) utilising Generalized Deduplication as data compression technique. Additionally I designed one of the first protocols with build in support for Generalized Deduplication and classic deduplication in hop-by-hop networks
